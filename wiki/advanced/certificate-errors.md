title: SABnzbd and SSL/TLS security
redirect_from: "/certificate-errors"
---
Usenet (aka Newsservers) offers SSL/TLS security. It’s called NNTPS, or NNTP with SSL. Just like HTTPS, it has two functions:

- Are you really talking to the server you want to talk to.
- Others can’t see what is being sent between client and server. So others can’t see 1) your login credentials and 2) what you’re downloading.

Currently there are still [a lot of non-secure newsservers](https://www.appelboor.com/newsservers/newsservers-with-SSL.html). The default setting of SABnzbd for existing servers is therefore not very strict. You can set it to `Strict` yourself in the Advanced settings on the [Servers](/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/servers) page. When you add a new server in SABnzbd 2.0.0+ it will be set to `Strict` by default.

You can completely turn off SABnzbd’s security checking, but then your connection does not offer you the security of the two functions above.

                'transport': 'beacon'
            });
        return false
    })
    // Do the magic when done
    $('#newsserver-test-result').on('load', function() {
        $('.progress').hide()
        $(this).show();
    });

Newsserver problems
-------------------
**Q: I get this error message "untrusted certificate". What is going on? What can I do?**

    Failed to connect: Server news.someserver.com uses an untrusted certificate [[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:590)]

**A: Your newsserver does not have valid certificates to verify it's identity. The certificates are self-signed and cannot be verified by a [trusted authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) or they are malicious.**

**You can do different things:**

1. Easy but not secure: Make the problem go away by not using SSL (untick SSL).
2. Easy but not secure: Ignore the problem, and instruct SABnzbd to ignore the problem: in SABnzbd’s Server-settings, under Advanced, set `Certificate verification` to `Disabled`. You have now an insecure SSL connection. <br> <span class="label label-danger">WARNING</span> Disabeling this check allows anyone to redirect and intercept your traffic using *any* certificate! It is comparable to not using SSL at all.
3. Hard, but secure: Check on [our Newsservers with SSL/TLS overview](https://www.appelboor.com/newsservers/newsservers-with-SSL.html) (and/or online newsserver SSL/TLS check above) the SSL/TLS-status of your newsserver.

    1. If the test or the overview shows an error message such as `OK NOK NOK` or `NOK NOK NOK`, the problem is on the side of the newsserver. You can ask the newsserver provider to solve that problem. That could be a hard path; the provider could deny they have a problem.

    2. If that site says `OK OK OK` or `OK OK NOK`, the problem is on your own site (read: your computer/NAS): incorrect certificates, a virusscanner doing strange things, or something else. That is not something SABnzbd cannot solve for you. And it is OS-dependent how to solve that.

**Q: I get this error message "hostname ... doesn't match"**

    Failed to connect: Server news.someserver.com uses an untrusted certificate [hostname 'news.someserver.com' doesn't match either of '*.othersite.com', 'othersite.com']

**A: your newsserver provider has some level of SSL, but the setup is not fully correct: they are using the certificates that do not belong to the hostname you're using. That is not correct.**

You can do different things:

1. Easy and half/half-secure: in SABnzbd’s Server-settings, under Advanced, set `Certificate verification` to `Default`/`Minimal`. Then try again.<br> <span class="label label-danger">WARNING</span> Disabeling this check allows anyone to redirect and intercept your traffic using *any* valid certificate!  It is comparable to not using SSL at all.
2. You can ask the newsserver provider to solve the problem. That could be a hard path; the provider could deny they have a problem.

* * *

**Q: Which Newsserver provider should I choose & use?**

**A: Choose one with triple OK on [our Newsservers with SSL/TLS overview](https://www.appelboor.com/newsservers/newsservers-with-SSL.html)**

* * *

**Q: I am a newsserver provider, what can I do?**

That depends on how your newsserver is set up:

* If you are a (Highwinds, Xennanews, etc) reseller, contact your wholesale provider (Highwinds, Xennanews, etc) to solve this. You will most likely need to provide a certificate to your provider
* If you are hosting your own newsserver, contact your newsserver administrator

NZB / RSS Index site problems
-----------------------------

NZB / RSS Index sites are HTTPS sites. HTTPS/SSL/TLS problems on the server side are now (2017) uncommon because web browsers have been rejecting incorrect SSL/TLS setup for some time now.

**Q: I get a certificate error trying to read a RSS or NZB**

    Failed to retrieve RSS from https://nzbindex.nl/rss/?q=bla&sort=agedesc&max=25: hostname u'nzbindex.nl' doesn't match either of 'www.nzbindex.com', 'nzbindex.com'

**A: Open the same URL in your Chrome web browser on the same machine, and on another machine. If Chrome complains too, you know the problem is on the server side.**

Thinks you can do:

1. Check if there is another URL that is secure. For example: nzbindex.COM is secure.
2. Contact the site owner and tell him about the problem.
3. Turn off `HTTPS certificate verification` in SABnzbd.

If Chrome does not complain, the problem might be on your side. That is not something SABnzbd cannot solve for you. And it is OS-dependent how to solve that.
