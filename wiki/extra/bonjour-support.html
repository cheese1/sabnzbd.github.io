title: Bonjour support
---
<p><em>1.0.0+ Only</em></p>
<p>SABnzbd supports Apple's Bonjour protocol to some extent.<br>
    Bonjour shows available network services without you having mess around with IP addresses and port numbers.<br>
    All Apple devices support it and will therefore be able to find your SABnzbd server easily. On other operating systems you'll have to install some add-ons to get Bonjour working; see the details below.<br>
    The Bonjour protocol is also known as ZeroConfig or Avahi on other platforms.
</p>
<p>Only the Safari browser has built-in support for Bonjour,<br>
    but there are add-ons for Firefox and Chrome.<br>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately our Bonjour implementation doesn't work on macOS El Capitan. We're not sure whether we can fix this.
</p>
<h3 id="toc0">Limitation</h3>
<p>Note that Bonjour will only work when you setup SABnzbd to communicate with other computers on your local network. A completely local installation (using 127.0.0.1 or localhost) will not be advertised on Bonjour. The protocol doesn't support this.</p>
<p>The speed may be disappointing. For some reason Bonjour likes to communicate over IPv6, which can be slow on some browsers.</p>
<h3 id="toc1">macOS</h3>
<p>There's nothing to install.<br>
    Start SABnzbd with the host name 0.0.0.0 (or empty) and it will advertise itself to all Bonjour clients on your local network.<br>
    Note that you need to enable Bonjour support in the Safari browser: Preferences-&gt;Bookmarks
</p>
<h3 id="toc2">Windows</h3>
<p>If you have iTunes installed, then Bonjour is installed too.<br>
    Otherwise, you'll have to install <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999" target="_blank">Bonjour Print services for Windows</a> from Apple's website.<br>
    All Apple devices will be able to find your SABnzbd server.<br>
    On Windows itself, only Safari for Windows supports Bonjour.
</p>
<h3 id="toc3">Debian/Ubuntu:</h3>
<p>Install two packages to get Bonjour working:</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libavahi-compat-libdnssd1</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The separate tool "avahi-discover" (package name "avahi-discover") can be handy as it will show all bonjour services on your LAN.<br>
    All Apple devices will be automatically able to find your SABnzbd server.<br>
    On Linux, the Konqueror browser (part of KDE) has built-in support for Bonjour/Avahi.

<h3 id="toc4">Android</h3>
<p>On Android you can see Bonjour services (like SABnzbd) on other devices on your LAN with "Bonjour Browser (see <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grokkt.android.bonjour">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grokkt.android.bonjour</a> ) and "Zeronconf Browser" (see <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melloware.zeroconf">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melloware.zeroconf</a> ). NB: you can only see them, not click on them</p>
