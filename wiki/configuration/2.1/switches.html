<h2 id="multi-core">Extra Par2 Parameters for macOS and Linux</h2>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> For Windows, see <a href="#multi-core-multipar">below</a>.</p>
<p>The macOS distribution of SABnzbd includes a multi-core version of the PAR2 program which will see improvements for those with multi-core processors. On Linux you will need to install the multi-core versions of <code>par2</code> yourself, <a href="/wiki/installation/multicore-par2">as described here</a>.</p>

<p>The behavior of multi-core PAR2 can be influenced by an extra parameter. By default it will use all available cores.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>-t1</code> Use it single-core</li>
    <li><code>-t&lt;n&gt;</code> Use <code>n</code> cores</li>
    <li><code>-t0</code> [par2tbb/macOS only] Use multi-core for repairs but not for verify (prevents disk trashing)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use the macOS release or the <code>par2-tbb</code> version on other platforms you can also set the process priority:</p>
<ul>
     <li><code>-pN</code> to process at normal priority [default]</li>
     <li><code>-pL</code> to process at low priority</li>
     <li><code>-pI</code> to process at idle (lowest) priority</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Specifying more than 1 extra parameter might not always work.</p>


<hr>
<h2 id="multi-core-multipar">Extra Par2 Parameters for Windows</h2>
<p>The Windows version of SABnzbd has MultiPar integrated which allows you to specify the multi-core behavior and memory usage. Additionally, you can also enable the use of the GPU. Beware: GPU performance varies between systems and can also be slower on some systems.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><code>/lc</code> Set this if you want to set number of using threads or want to disable extra feature (SSE2 is always used).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/lc&lt;n&gt;</code> where <code>n</code> is from 1 to 11 for specific number of cores</li>
            <li><code>/lc12</code> to use quarter number of physical cores</li>
            <li><code>/lc13</code> to use half of physical cores</li>
            <li><code>/lc14</code> to use 3/4 number of physical cores</li>
            <li><code>/lc15</code> to use the number of physical cores (disable Hyper-Threading)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may set additional combinations by adding the following options to the already specified value:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>+16</code> to disable SSSE3</li>
            <li><code>+128</code> to disable CLMUL</li>
            <li><code>+256</code> to disable JIT</li>
            <li><code>+512</code> to disable AVX2</li>
            <li><code>+32</code> or <code>+64</code> (slower device) to enable GPU acceleration</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For example:</strong> <code>/lc1</code> to use single core, <code>/lc32</code> to enable GPU usage or <code>/lc45</code> to use half cores and GPU usage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><code>/m</code> Set this if you want to set memory usage. Value is specified from 1 to 7 (1/7th to 7/8th):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/m0</code> = Default (between 6/8 and 7/8 mostly)</li>
            <li><code>/m1</code> = 1/8, 12.5%</li>
            <li><code>/m4</code> = 4/8, 50%</li>
            <li><code>/m7</code> = 7/8, 87.5%</li>
