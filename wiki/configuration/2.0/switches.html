<h2 id="toc7">Multi-core PAR2</h2>
<p><a name="multi-core"></a> The Windows and macOS distribution of SABnzbd include a multi-core version of the PAR2 program which will see improvements for those with multi-core processors. For Linux you will need to install the multi-core versions of <code>par2</code> yourself, <a href="/wiki/installation/multicore-par2">as described here</a>.</p>
<p>
    The behaviour of multi-core PAR2 can be influenced by an extra parameter.
    This option is only of use to users running the multi-core par2 version, so do not specify the value if you are running the normal (single-core) version of par2.<br>
    These are the choices:
</p>
<p>
    <code>-t-</code> Use it single-core<br>
    <code>-t0</code> Use multi-core for repairs but not for verify (prevents disk trashing)<br>
    <code>-t+</code> Always use multi-core<br>

    You may need to experiment a bit to get the best behaviour for your system.
</p>
<p>If you use the <code>par2-tbb</code> version (default for Windows and macOS) then you can also set the process priority:<br>
     <code>-pN</code> to process at normal priority [default]<br>
     <code>-pL</code> to process at low priority<br>
     <code>-pI</code> to process at idle priority<br>
</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Specifying more than 1 extra parameter might not work on every platform.</p>

<p>Should you have another variant of PAR2, you specify its required parameters here.</p>


<h2 id="toc8">Nice to reduce CPU priority</h2>
<p><a name="nice"></a> When SABnzbd runs external tools like <strong>par2</strong> and <strong>unrar</strong>, these tools may use up all CPU capacity.
    If you set parameters in the <strong>nice</strong> option box, the tool will be used (if installed).
    You will need to experiment with the parameters. Leaving the box empty will disable the use of <strong>nice</strong>.<br>
    Popular parameters are <code>-n10</code>.<br>
    For more info, see the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/nice" target="_blank">nice man-page</a>
</p>
<h2 id="toc9">IONice to reduce disk priority</h2>
<p><a name="ionice"></a> When SABnzbd runs external tools like <strong>par2</strong> and <strong>unrar</strong>, these tools may use up all disk capacity
    This can make simultaneous use of the system problematic, e.g. when you want to watch a movie.
    If you set parameters in the <strong>ionice</strong> option box, the tool will be used (if installed).
    You will need to experiment with the parameters. Leaving the box empty will disable the use of <strong>ionice</strong>.<br>
    Popular parameters are <code>-c2 -n4</code>.<br>
    For more info, see the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice" target="_blank">ionice man-page</a>
</p>
<p>Be careful, using wrong parameters will make all external tools fail!</p>
