<p>SABnzbd can read RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites.
    These sites will offer you the latest downloads or return results based on some query. For a list of supported RSS sites <a href="/wiki/introduction/nzb-sources">see here.</a>
</p>
<p>Each feed is analysed using filters.
    A filter looks for text pattern in the title of the entries.
    A filter "matches" if the text it contains is found inside a title.
    You can add <code>*</code> characters that will match arbitrary parts of the title.
    There are accept and reject filters.
    The filters are analysed in order and the first matching one will be selected.

<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Some website feeds require the inclusion of authentication details in the URL. Please see the sites for details on connecting to your particular feed provider.</p>

<h3>An example</h3>
<p>
    Suppose you subscribe to the feed <code>http://www.tvnzb.com/tvnzb_new.rss</code>.<br>
    The output of titles in this feed could be:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 2
My first teen steps hdtv xvid Part 1
My first baby steps xvid Part 1
My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 2
The making of My first baby steps xvid hdtv</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now suppose you want to get all "My ... first steps" episodes, but only when marked hdtv.<br>
    And your not interested in "Making of".<br>
    So, you set up these filters:
</p>

    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Accept || first*steps*hdtv</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>Reject</code> filter should come first, otherwise the <code>Accept</code> filter will also pick the "Making of".</p>
<p>For each feed you can set a default <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">category</a> or (when no categories are set up) the <a href="/wiki/extra/job-options">job-options</a>.<br>
    Also, for each filter you override the defaults (also for <code>Reject</code> filter, but this has no use).
</p>
<p>It's also possible to setup a <code>Required</code> filter.<br>
    This means that the following filters are only applied when a title matches the <code>Required</code> filter.<br>
    Suppose you are only interested in the "hdtv" format, you setup this:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Requires || hdtv
Accept || first*steps
Accept || second*steps</code>
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="toc0">Filters</h3>
<p>These are all the provided filters.<br>
Please note that <code>From SxxEyy</code> will only work when SABnzbd recognizes the season/episode notation in the job title.<br>
Note also that <code>RequireCat</code> only works for indexers that provide categories and whose categories have been mapped to your own (See <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">Config-&gt;Categories</a>)</p>

<h3 id="toc2">Regular expressions</h3>
<p>If you prefix a filter with <code>re:</code> it will be interpreted as a Python regular expression.<br>
    Here's a <a href="http://www.developer.com/lang/article.php/3330231" target="_blank">tutorial on regular expressions</a>.<br>
    For all the details see <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html" target="_blank">the Python manual</a>.

<h3 id="toc3">Automatic processing</h3>
<p>If you check the checkbox next to the name of the feed, it will be automatically processed.<br>
    The time between scans can be set with <code>RSS checking rate</code>.<br>
    <span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> You can also override this by using the Scheduler, in this case the  <code>RSS checking rate</code> will be ignored.

<h3 id="toc4">First batch</h3>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> to prevent the download of a (potentially) large backlog, the first batch of NZBs will not be downloaded automatically. These lines are marked with an asterisk <code>*</code>. Only new jobs in subsequent read-outs will be downloaded.<br>
    If you still want the matches in the first batch to be downloaded, click on the <code>Force Download</code> button.
