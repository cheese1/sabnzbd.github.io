<p>SABnzbd comes with sensible defaults to work, however, there are plenty of options and tweaks to tailor SABnzbd to your needs.<br>
    View the relevant page for more information on what an option does and more.
</p>
<p>All configuration data is stored in the so-called INI file. Which INI file used, you can see on the Configuration main page.
Default locations for each operating system can be found in <a href="/wiki/advanced/directory-setup">Folder Setup</a>.

<p>SABnzbd relies on using existing utilities to extract, repair, and process files once they have been downloaded.<br>
    Some of these utilities are provided with SABnzbd while some require the user to install, also some may only be optional depending on how you use SABnzbd.
